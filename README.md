Hi, I'm Persevearence Mochose Matla — a passionate and adaptable individual currently upskilling in Front-End Web Development through the ALX ProDev Program. With a background as a Virtual Assistant and Private Tutor, I bring a unique blend of organizational precision, problem-solving skills, and people-centered service to everything I do.

I hold a Bachelor of Veterinary Science from Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia and have experience supporting clients remotely with tasks like calendar and email management, document handling, and data entry. I'm fluent in English, speak Sotho natively, and can converse in Russian.

As I transition into tech, I’m excited to combine my administrative strengths and passion for learning with hands-on coding skills — building user-friendly, accessible, and impactful web applications. On GitHub, you’ll find my journey in front-end development: from responsive websites to JavaScript practice projects.
